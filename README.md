# Implementation of Algorithms Covered in Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains implementations of some of the algorithms covered in [MIT 6.7920: Reinforcement Learning: Foundations And Methods](https://web.mit.edu/6.7920/www/index.html) in Python.

The directory `src` contains Python code which can be run directly.
The algorithms that require training neural networks use [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and are compatible with GPUs that support CUDA.
